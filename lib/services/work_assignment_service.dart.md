## WorkAssignmentRecommendation Class

### Recommendation Structure
```dart
class WorkAssignmentRecommendation {
  final String employeeId;              // Employee identifier
  final String employeeName;            // Employee display name
  final double suitabilityScore;        // Overall suitability (0.0-1.0)
  final List<String> reasons;           // Human-readable reasoning
  final double estimatedHours;          // Adjusted time estimate
  final double confidenceLevel;         // System confidence (0.0-1.0)
  final Map<String, dynamic> assignmentDetails; // Detailed scoring breakdown
}
```

### Recommendation Properties
- **`suitabilityScore`**: Composite score from all factors (0.0 = unsuitable, 1.0 = perfect match)
- **`confidenceLevel`**: System confidence in the recommendation
- **`reasons`**: List of human-readable factors contributing to the score
- **`assignmentDetails`**: Detailed breakdown of all scoring factors
- **`estimatedHours`**: AI-adjusted time estimate based on employee performance

## WorkAssignmentService Class

### Core Assignment Method
```dart
Future<List<WorkAssignmentRecommendation>> getAssignmentRecommendations({
  required String orderId,
  required List<String> requiredSkills,
  required DateTime deadline,
  required double estimatedHours,
  required Map<String, dynamic> orderDetails,
})
```
**Returns**: Top 5 most suitable employees for the work order

### Assignment Algorithm Flow
```dart
1. Retrieve all active employees from database
2. Calculate suitability score for each employee
3. Filter employees with score > 0.3 (reasonably suitable)
4. Sort by suitability score (descending)
5. Return top 5 recommendations
```

## Multi-Factor Scoring System

### 1. Skills Matching (40% Weight)
```dart
double _calculateSkillScore(Employee employee, List<String> requiredSkills)
```
**Factors Considered:**
- **Primary Skill Match**: Direct skill matching against requirements
- **Skill Diversity Bonus**: Additional points for multiple relevant skills
- **Skill Parsing**: Intelligent parsing of skill strings to enum values

**Scoring Logic:**
- Exact skill matches get full points
- Related skills get partial credit
- Multiple relevant skills get diversity bonus
- Returns normalized score 0.0-1.0

### 2. Availability & Workload (25% Weight)
```dart
Future<double> _calculateAvailabilityScore(
  Employee employee,
  DateTime deadline,
  double estimatedHours,
)
```
**Factors Considered:**
- **Current Workload**: Number of active assignments
- **Workload Limits**: Based on full-time vs part-time availability
- **Time Availability**: Deadline feasibility assessment
- **Consecutive Days**: Fatigue factor from long work streaks

**Scoring Components:**
- **Workload Factor**: Current assignments vs capacity
- **Time Factor**: Hours until deadline assessment
- **Consecutive Days Factor**: Work streak penalty/bonus

### 3. Performance History (20% Weight)
```dart
double _calculatePerformanceScore(Employee employee, List<String> requiredSkills)
```
**Factors Considered:**
- **Average Rating**: Overall quality rating (0-5 scale)
- **Completion Rate**: On-time delivery percentage
- **Recent Performance**: Last 5 assignments quality
- **Task-Specific History**: Performance on similar tasks

**Scoring Adjustments:**
- Base score from average rating (normalized to 0-1)
- Completion rate adjustment (target 80%)
- Recent performance adjustment (30% weight)
- New employee neutral score (0.5)

### 4. Experience Level (10% Weight)
```dart
double _calculateExperienceScore(Employee employee, List<String> requiredSkills)
```
**Factors Considered:**
- **Years of Experience**: Base experience score (capped at 10 years)
- **Certifications**: Bonus for relevant certifications
- **Specializations**: Bonus for relevant specializations
- **Task Relevance**: Experience in required skills

**Scoring Formula:**
```dart
experienceScore = (yearsExperience / 10.0).clamp(0.0, 1.0)
certificationBonus = certifications.length * 0.1
specializationBonus = specializations.length * 0.05
finalScore = (experienceScore + certificationBonus + specializationBonus).clamp(0.0, 1.0)
```

### 5. Work Preferences (5% Weight)
```dart
double _calculatePreferenceScore(Employee employee, Map<String, dynamic> orderDetails)
```
**Factors Considered:**
- **Specialization Match**: Order type matches employee specializations
- **Remote Work Preference**: Alignment with remote work capability
- **Schedule Preferences**: Work hours alignment
- **Work Type Preferences**: Task type preferences

## Intelligent Assignment Features

### Auto-Assignment Functionality
```dart
Future<bool> autoAssignWork({
  required String orderId,
  required List<String> requiredSkills,
  required DateTime deadline,
  required double estimatedHours,
  required String assignedBy,
  required Map<String, dynamic> orderDetails,
})
```
**Automatic Assignment Logic:**
1. Get assignment recommendations
2. Check if recommendations exist
3. Validate confidence level (> 0.6 threshold)
4. Create work assignment record
5. Update employee workload
6. Return success/failure status

### Confidence Thresholds
- **High Confidence (> 0.8)**: Excellent match, auto-assign immediately
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Good match, auto-assign with notification
- **Low Confidence (< 0.6)**: Manual review recommended

### Batch Assignment
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> batchAssignWork({
  required List<String> orderIds,
  required List<String> requiredSkills,
  required DateTime deadline,
  required String assignedBy,
})
```
**Batch Processing Features:**
- Process multiple orders simultaneously
- Individual success/failure tracking
- Comprehensive results reporting
- Error aggregation and handling
- Success rate calculation
